		<h1>Club History</h1>
		<p> 
			The predecessor of HeHe FC was a group of Cantonese speaking players from different discontinuned teams and some of them still wanted to continue in competitive games. HeHe FC was then established in 2015 starting with a 10 men squad. They started participating in a 7 vs 7 futsal league held by Sporthouse in Redwood City. Time was tough at the beggining due to lack of squad quality and depth. As time has gone by, the group grew bigger and bigger and started to get results. They got into knockout stages multiple times and once won the 2nd place of the league tournament. <br><br>

			With the expansion of the team, HeHe FC had recruited enough man power to also take part in a 8v8 Chinese outdoor league held by NCCSF. They finished 3rd place in the first year of participation and was crowned champion the next year. HeHe FC joined 11 vs 11 league in 2020 and held 2nd place until the pandemic hit.
